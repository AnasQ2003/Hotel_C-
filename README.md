# Hotel_C-
The main purpose or objective of this project on Hotel Management System is to manage the details of rooms, customers, booking and other services of the hotel. This project helps to reduce the work manually and this application is very useful even you are a distance away or far from that place. 
This is very useful for the customers for booking or reserve the hotel rooms for their work or for any other purpose. This will help the customers in booking because it is all a computer system in which there will be no error as compare to human there as many errors occur like balancing time, budget, in maintaining records keeping records of all customers that what they will need and so on. This program is very user friendly and very simple because Iâ€™ve covered all the topics of my course in a C++ language.
